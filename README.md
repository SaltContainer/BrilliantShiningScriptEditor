The most recent version can be downloaded from the releases page. Supported features are described further down.

## Features

### Script Editing

A full-blown editor for all scripts used by the game!
- Edit any script in a readable format and let the editor do the conversion work for you
  - If working on individual scripts is too much work, you can also edit full script files
- Editor powered by Monaco Editor, with support for autocompletion and syntax highlighting
- "Compile" the script to validate if there are any missing arguments or other issues
- Add, delete or rename scripts

### Data Reference

A tool to reference commands that can be used and get details on what they do and what arguments they need!
- Also reference all other argument types including any custom ones added
- Custom Command, Flag, System Flag, Work Variable, and File names that can be imported and used within the script editor

## Upcoming Features

### Settings Window

Edit some settings so you feel comfortable scripting in the way you want
- "Assembly" syntax vs "Function" syntax
  - Assembly is the current syntax (something like "_LDVAL var_94 6.0") and Function would be in the style of ev-as (something like "_LDVAL(var_94, 6.0)").
- "Typed" prefixes vs "Symbol" prefixes
  - Typed is the current prefixes (var_, flag_, sys_) and Symbol would be in the style of ev-as (@, #, $).
- Use quotation marks for labels
  - No quotation marks is the current syntax.

### Multiple script editor tabs

Edit multiple scripts and/or script files at once, without worrying about having to save every time you want to switch between all of them

## Requirements

To start editing game files, you will first need to obtain them. You can use Ryujinx or yuzu to extract the game data, specifically the RomFS. You can also use any other tool that extracts the game files from your legally acquired ROM (hactool, etc.).

### Ryujinx
Simply right-click the ROM in your ROM list, then select Extract Data, then RomFS.<br>

### yuzu
Simply right-click the ROM in your ROM list, then select Dump RomFS, then Dump RomFS.<br>

**Do note that yuzu does not create the "Data" folder between "romfs" and "StreamingAssets" and you will need to create it yourself before loading the files in the editor.**<br>

In all cases, the files will be found where your emulator dumped the files. **The editor expects the folder structure "\<directory\>/Data/StreamingAssets/...". Make sure to replicate it properly before loading it.** After the changes have been exported, only use the edited files and follow the many tutorials online for modding your Nintendo Switch games. Make sure that the folder structure is correct (Data/StreamingAssets/...).

Currently, as of the latest version, the editor edits the following files:
- "/Data/StreamingAssets/AssetAssistant/Dpr/ev_script"
There is currently no need for other files, but the editor will still require the correct RomFS folder structure.
