## Upcoming Features

### Custom Flag, System Flag, and Work names

Useful for large-scale mods that require new flags to be used.<br>
This can be done currently by editing the bundled JSON files, but a more user-friendly method will eventually be implemented.

## Requirements

To start editing game files, you will first need to obtain them. You can use Ryujinx or yuzu to extract the game data, specifically the RomFS. You can also use any other tool that extracts the game files from your legally acquired ROM (hactool, etc.).

### Ryujinx
Simply right-click the ROM in your ROM list, then select Extract Data, then RomFS.<br>

### yuzu
Simply right-click the ROM in your ROM list, then select Dump RomFS, then Dump RomFS.<br>

**Do note that yuzu does not create the "Data" folder between "romfs" and "StreamingAssets" and you will need to create it yourself before loading the files in the editor.**<br>

In all cases, the files will be found where your emulator dumped the files. **The editor expects the folder structure "\<directory\>/Data/StreamingAssets/...". Make sure to replicate it properly before loading it.** After the changes have been exported, only use the edited files and follow the many tutorials online for modding your Nintendo Switch games. Make sure that the folder structure is correct (Data/StreamingAssets/...).

Currently, as of the latest version, the editor edits the following files:
- "/Data/StreamingAssets/AssetAssistant/Dpr/ev_script"
There is currently no need for other files, but the editor will still require the correct RomFS folder structure.
